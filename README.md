# SolarScore

In times of rising energy prices and the danger of climate change we want to achieve that solar plant owners get the most out of their solar plant.Based on the weather forecast for the next days SolarScore predicts the solar plant's power output so that the owner can plan when to for example charge her/his electric vehicle and it is avoided that energy is not used directly. 

## How to Setup and Run
In order to setup the project, please proceed as follows:

### MapQuest API-key
Create a new environment with the `environment.yml` in the root folder as described [here](https://github.com/TechLabs-Dortmund/solar-score/wiki/How-to-import-the-Python-packages)


### MapQuest API-key
With the help of MapQuest the coordinates are requested for a specific adress.Please register at their [webpage]( https://developer.mapquest.com/plan_purchase/steps/business_edition/business_edition_free/register) and copy your personal API key in an `.env` file:

```shell
api_key = <that_is_an_api_key>
```

### Frontend
Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and run the following commands from the `website` folder:

```bash
  npm install
```

```bash
  npm run build
```

```bash
  npm start
```

### Backend
Run the following commands from the `interface` folder:

```bash
  npm manage.py makemigrations
```
```bash
  npm manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
```
```bash
  npm manage.py runserver
```

### Pipeline
To test the calculation pipeline you can use following commands from the top level folder:
```bash
python -m fire manage.py testfetching
```
```bash
python -m fire manage.py testinferencing
```
```bash
python -m fire manage.py testdrawing
```
The complete routine is started via
```bash
python -m fire manage.py runpipeline
```
While using it in a terminal it assumes default values for `address` and `p_max` input values.

## Examples
You can see a brief overview of how to use the main functionality below

```javascript
import Component from 'my-project'

function App() {
  return <Component />
}
```

  
## Roadmap
- Optimize model predictions by further learning
- Feedback loop for user data (Import)
- Export of forecast data
