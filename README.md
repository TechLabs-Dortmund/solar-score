# SolarScore
In times of rising energy prices and the danger of climate change we want to achieve that solar plant owners get the most out of their solar plant.Based on the weather forecast for the next days SolarScore predicts the solar plant's power output so that the owner can plan when to for example charge her/his electric vehicle and it is avoided that energy is not used directly. 

## Requirements

### OS
At the moment our project only works with Windows as the operating system. 
Not all packages that are part of our template environment exist on Mac in the same version.
Further, the deep learning model trained on Mac and saved as `model.pkl` cannot be easily loaded on Windows.

### Source
Please clone [this](https://github.com/TechLabs-Dortmund/solar-score.git) repository using "https://github.com/TechLabs-Dortmund/solar-score.git" onto your computer.

### Python
Make sure to install the python package manager [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution).
Now you can create a new environment from `environment.yml` lying in the `interface` folder as described [here](https://github.com/TechLabs-Dortmund/solar-score/wiki/How-to-import-the-Python-packages)

### Node.js
Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

### MapQuest API-key
With the help of MapQuest the coordinates are requested for a specific adress. 
Please register at their [webpage](https://developer.mapquest.com/user/login/sign-up) and copy your personal API key in an `.env` file to the `interface.data` folder:

```shell
api_key = "<that_is_an_api_key>"
```
## How to Setup
In order to setup the project, please proceed with the following steps.

### Frontend
Start a node command prompt and run the following commands from the `interface.website` folder:

```bash
  npm install
```

```bash
  npm run build
```

If you get the error message: `JavaScript Heap Out of Memory` please use the next command before retry
```bash
  set NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=4096
```

### Backend
Run the following commands from the `interface` folder:

```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
```
```bash
  python manage.py migrate --run-syncdb
```

## How to Run

### Frontend
```bash
  npm start
```

### Backend
```bash
  python manage.py runserver
```

### (Pipeline)
The following steps are not necessary for setup or running.

To test the calculation pipeline you can use following commands from the `interface` folder:
```bash
python -m fire pipeline.py testfetching
```
```bash
python -m fire pipeline.py testinferencing
```
```bash
python -m fire pipeline.py testdrawing
```
The complete routine is started via
```bash
python -m fire pipeline.py run
```
While using it in a terminal it assumes default values for `address` and `p_max` input values.
  
## Roadmap
- Optimize model predictions by further learning
- Feedback loop for user data (Import)
- Export of forecast data
